Execute telnet SERVERNAME 25. This connects telnet to port 25 on the server with the name SERVERNAME. The name or IP address of the server for a domain can be determined by dig DOMAIN -t MX. If there is no own MX record for a domain, the corresponding A-record must be used.
If the TCP connection can be established, telnet responds with the message Connected to SERVERNAME. and Escape character is' ^]'. .
Now you can send an e-mail via SMTP protocol. The best way to do this is to use a recipient address for which the connected mail server is responsible.
