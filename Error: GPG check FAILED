Environment
CloudLinux OS 8.9
Solution
Please run this command to work around the issue

# rpm --import https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux
Cause
The GPG key for the xfsdump package was not installed, resulting in a GPG check failure during the package installation, which was resolved by importing the necessary key from the AlmaLinux repository.

cloudlinux-release-8.9-2.el8 package contains an updated AlmaLinux key, but won't help with current systems. Therefore, please apply the workaround anyway.
